    <p><strong>Tea</strong> is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of the <em>Camellia sinensis</em>, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different types of tea; some, like <i class="taxonomy">Darjeeling</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Chinese greens</i>, have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. <em>Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily by its caffeine content<em>.
      Tea originated in the region encompassing today's<i class="place">Northeast India</i>, <i class="place">north Myanmar</i>, <i class="place">Southwest China</i> and <i class="place">Tibet</i>, where it was used as a medicinal drink by various ethnic groups in the region. An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by <i class="person">Hua Tuo</i>. It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in <i class="person">India.</i>

      The term <i class="taxonomy">herbal tea</i> refers to drinks not made from Camellia sinensis: infusions of fruit, leaves, or other parts of the plant, such as steeps of rosehip, chamomile, or rooibos. These may be called tisanes or herbal infusions to prevent confusion with "tea" made from the tea plant.</p>
